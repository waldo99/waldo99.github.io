		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I&#039;m spending a month in Italy starting next weekend (!!) and I booked 5 days in Tropea. I&#039;m all set as for hotels and transportation but the place I&#039;ll be staying at is downtown, and I can&#039;t find info about the beach. Do I have to pay to access? Or do I need a taxi to get there? Any info would be great. Thanks!]]></description>
